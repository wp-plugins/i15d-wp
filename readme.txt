**i**nternationalizatio**n**.

= I don't understand the purpose of this plugin... Could you explain it a little further? =

WordPress is by default really restrictive on what characters you can use inside your permalinks.<br />
*i15d WP* changes the WordPress behavior to be less restrictive with the characters, so that you can 
start using more characters (i.e. non-ASCII characters) on your permalinks without being truncated or deleted.

= Why does WordPress make such a character restriction on permalinks? =

For just one simple reason: **Characters Encodings** (specially multi-byte character encodings).<br />
So, even if the permalinks are similar but with different encoding, Wordpress won't be able to process
them equally and will, therefore, issue a *404 Not Found* HTTP Error.

= Does this plugin fix this issue? =

Unfortunately... NO.<br />
Fixing the encodings issue is a really complicated and time-consuming task but we will consider this issue 
in further versions.

= Why did you develop this plugin? =

This plugin was originally a custom software made for some webmasters of [IDN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name "Internationalized domain name on Wikipedia")
Blogs and since maybe someone else might find it useful, I released this little work to the public **:-P**.
