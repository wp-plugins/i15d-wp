== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= i15d stands for... =

**i**nternationalize**d**.

= I don't understand this plugin purpose... Can you explain it a little further? =

By default WordPress is really restricted on what characters you can use inside
you permalinks, *i15d WP* changes the WordPress behavior to be more soft with the
characters restriction, so you can start using more characters (like non-ASCII characters) 
on your permalinks without being truncated or deleted.

= Why does WordPress make such a character restriction on permalinks? =

For just one simple thing: **Characters Encodings** (specially multi-byte character encodings).<br />
So, even if the permalinks are similar but with different encoding, Wordpress won't be able to process
them equally and will, therefore, issue a *404 Not Found* HTTP Error.

= So, this plugin fix this issue? =

Unfortunately... NO, fixing the encodings issue is a real mess but we will kept and eye on this issue
in further versions of this plugin.

= Why did you develop this plugin? =

This plugin was originally a custom software made for some webmasters of [IDN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name "Internationalized domain name on Wikipedia")
Blogs and since maybe someone may find it useful, i release this little work to the public **:-P**.
